- takes care of physical bit stream transfer between neighboring systems
	- point-to-point or multi-point connections
	- full-duplex or half-duplex modes of operation
- defines interaction of a single device with the physical medium
	- physical and electrical parameters of the medium interface
	- exact specifications about how are data represented on the medium
		- signal levels, data encoding, data modulation
- can include media access control (MAC, typically on layer 2)
- services to the upper layer:
	- transmission of raw bit streams
	- physical connection establishment and termination
- examples: RS232, Ethernet 10Base-T, Ethernet 100Base-TX
