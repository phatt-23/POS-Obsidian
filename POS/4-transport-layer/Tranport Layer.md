- provides tranparent (reliable) data transfer between two entities in the transport layer (end users)
- establishes addressing of transport-layer entities in scope of a device with a single network address
	- multiple transport session may exists between two systems in parallel
	- allows multiplexing of multiple connections with a single virtual circuit
- takes care of: 
	- segmentation and reassembly
	- error correction
	- flow control
- services provided to the upper layer:
	- connection-oriented services - TCP (Transport Control Protocol)
	- connectionless services - UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- stands between the network infrastructure and end-systems that use it
	- transport session is established directly between end-system transport entities
	- intermediate systems don't participate
- examples: TCP (Transport Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
